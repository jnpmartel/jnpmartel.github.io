## Abstract
Almost all real-world AI and robotics applications are power-constrained and depend on real-time understanding of 
the robot's environment. Robotic systems that rely on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and other perception 
algorithms, would greatly benefit from novel emerging computing paradigms such as computation on or near the focal plane. 
In this workshop, we explore the emerging unconventional perception methods such as computation directly within the light 
sensor, performing early-stage recognition before converting signals to digital form, and implementing all or parts of 
the deep neural networks on the chip. In these methods, only where features of value are identified is data actually 
transferred to later stages of the vision pipeline. We aim to bring researchers from academia and industry from across 
multiple disciplines, including i) hardware design, ii) compiler, iii) software/algorithm design, and iv) holistic 
design to demonstrate the power of novel computational approaches using these unconventional sensors. These novel 
approaches enable a variety of recognition and tracking applications with exceptionally low latency, high frame rate 
and low power.

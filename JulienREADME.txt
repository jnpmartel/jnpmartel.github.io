If you want the documentation on hugo:
https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/

If you want to see what you are doing when you modify the website:
> hugo server 
then go to the http://localhost:1313/~jnmartel

If you want to compile the website:
> hugo 

If you want to deploy the website:
use your favorite ftp client and upload the "public" folder you got 
from the compilation above.
for stanford: connect via VPN (maybe not even needed), then 
> sftp jnmartel@cardinal.stanford.edu

when in sftp use 'ls' and 'put -r' to upload

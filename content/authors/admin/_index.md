I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Stanford Computational Imaging Group
led by Gordon Wetzstein. My research interests lie in the co-development of
algorithms and hardware to enable new imaging possibilities. In particular I am
interested in developing systems and algorithms using vision sensors that contain\
fixed or programmable processing capabilities in each pixel such as Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS) and Focal Plane Sensor Processors (FPSP).
